# Real-Time-Multi-threaded-Application-Simulator
#Problem Statement:
Description: Develop a simulator to demonstrate multithreading models (e.g., Many-to
One, One-to-Many, Many-to-Many) and thread synchronization using semaphores and 
monitors. The simulator should visualize thread states and interactions, providing insights 
into thread management and CPU scheduling in multi-threaded environments. 

version: 4.0.3

Functionalities of Modules
1. models.py : It contains multi models to simulate threads multithreading(One-to-One, One-to-Many, Many-to-Many,Many-to-One).
2. synchronization.py: This file has important classes such as semaphores to control resource locking(mutex in c++), and Monitor which will monitor locks and notify other threads as soon as the lock is released.
3. logger.py: This module provides centralized logging functionality for the thread 
simulator.
4.  simulator.py: This module provides the core simulation logic that coordinates threads, 
processes, and synchronization.
5.  ui.py: This module provides the graphical user interface for the thread simulator.
6.  main.py: Integrates and Implements all the modules together 
7. utils.py : It will make sure safe console output by the Thread.(not utilised)
